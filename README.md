You are feesh and you are quite literally a fish. You meet with your friend Bro and then you embark on an adventure to escape the confines of your society which happens to be in a fish tank. Meet Larry, Hatfish, Sean and Gerald  as you learn what its like to live in the society and try to make an ambitious escape while collecting bebe carrots, big carrots, fish??? and more.

Art style and creative direction are clearly very heavily inspired by Nintendo 64 games and early 3D platformers. The movement is not the greatest but I did spend a decent amount of time working on it.

Original Score created by Jake Torres and Sarah Sanzebin
